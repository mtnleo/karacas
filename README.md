# Karaca's Web
Karaca's Web is an encryption website that allows you to encrypt/decrypt using Karaca's method.

It's a simple yet effective way to showcase how to use the method,
allowing new students to get introduced to it.

In Karaca's website you can encrypt text and send it to others to decrypt it.

It also lets you create your own encryption options based on Karaca's.
You can:
- Edit the last letters of the encrypted word or get rid of them completely (up to 10 letters).
- Choose whether to reverse the encrypted word or not, adding/substracting secrecy to the message.
- Changing the vowels value by other different numbers.

------------
On top of that, for those who want to inquire more about how the algorithm actually works,
the user can access a simple but effective explanation about how Karaca's encryption algorithm works.

Website link will soon be available.
